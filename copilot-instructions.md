Project Description — Physio Aid

Physio Aid is an interactive web-based healthcare recommendation system designed to assist users in identifying the right remedies and specialists based on their pain areas or symptoms. Many individuals struggle to determine which type of medical professional to consult when experiencing discomfort. This often leads to delayed treatment or incorrect self-care.

Physio Aid solves this by offering a simple and intuitive platform where users can register or log in, select the area where they experience pain, and receive personalized recommendations. These recommendations include home-based remedies, exercises, and preventive healthcare practices covering multiple medical domains such as:

Physiotherapy

Dental care

Migraine-related care

Dermatology

Ophthalmology

Users follow these recommendations for a specific period (e.g., one week). If their condition does not improve, the system automatically notifies them and suggests a trusted specialist relevant to their pain type or symptoms. The platform also features a personal dashboard where users can track progress, view previous recommendations, and monitor recurring issues.

By combining user input with symptom-based suggestions, Physio Aid promotes early diagnosis, timely action, and informed medical decisions. It focuses on improving user convenience, ensuring secure handling of health data, and encouraging preventive healthcare practices.
